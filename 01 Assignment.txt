List out the features of HTML5

Semantic Elements: HTML5 introduced several new semantic elements like <header>, <nav>, <article>, <section>, <footer>, and <aside>. These elements provide a clearer structure to web documents, making it easier for both developers and assistive technologies to understand the content's meaning.

Audio and Video: HTML5 includes native support for embedding audio and video elements directly into web pages, using the <audio> and <video> tags. This eliminates the need for third-party plugins like Flash.

Canvas: The <canvas> element allows for dynamic, scriptable rendering of 2D shapes and images. Developers can use JavaScript to draw graphics, create animations, and build interactive games and visualizations.

SVG Support: HTML5 includes native support for Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG), allowing developers to create vector graphics and animations directly in HTML documents.

Web Storage: HTML5 introduced the localStorage and sessionStorage APIs, which allow developers to store data locally on the user's device. This is useful for building offline web applications and improving performance.

Web Workers: Web Workers enable multi-threading in web applications, allowing long-running scripts to run in the background without affecting the user interface's responsiveness.

Geolocation: HTML5 provides a Geolocation API that allows websites to request the user's location information (with their consent). This feature is handy for location-based services and maps.

Drag and Drop: HTML5 introduces native support for drag-and-drop operations, making it easier to create intuitive user interfaces with elements that can be dragged and dropped within a web page.

Form Enhancements: HTML5 introduces new form input types like <input type="date">, <input type="email">, <input type="url">, and more. It also includes form validation attributes like required, min, max, and pattern.

WebSocket: WebSocket is a protocol introduced in HTML5 that enables bidirectional communication between the server and the client, providing real-time capabilities for web applications.

Responsive Images: HTML5 includes the <picture> element and the srcset attribute, which allow developers to provide multiple image sources and sizes based on the user's device and screen resolution.

Local File Access: HTML5 allows web applications to request limited access to the user's local file system, making it possible to read and write files with user permission.

Offline Application Cache: HTML5 introduces the Application Cache API, which allows web developers to create offline-capable web applications by specifying which resources should be cached for offline use.

Improved Accessibility: HTML5 includes features like the aria-* attributes and improved support for semantic markup, making it easier to create accessible web content for users with disabilities.

Cross-document Messaging: With the window.postMessage() method, HTML5 provides a secure way for documents from different domains to communicate with each other.

ContentEditable: The contenteditable attribute allows elements to become editable by the user, making it easier to create rich-text editors and interactive content.
